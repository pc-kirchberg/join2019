Positions in the Pupils' Committee
==================================

Changes Since Last Year
-----------------------

William, can you please edit this, I really can't be bothered

President
---------

The President is the executive of the Pupils' Committee. They represent not only the views of the Pupils' Committee, but of the student populace as a whole. They must ensure that all Pupils' Committee members are treated fairly and with respect. Although they are individually superior to every member, they are subordinate to the Committee as a whole.

Becoming President is not easy, but neither is being President. Candidates must be serious and know that they can take on the responsibility. Prior experience in the Pupils' Committee is essential.

You must be at least 16 years old (on the day of the election) to apply for the Presidency

Vice-President
--------------

The Vice-President assists the President in their duties, and replaces them in case of absence.

To ensure continuity, if the President is from S7, the Vice-President must be from S6 or below.

You must be at least 16 years old (on the day of the election) to apply for the Presidency
